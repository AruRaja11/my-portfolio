About Me
I'm Jayanth J K, an enthusiastic Automotive Design Engineer with a deep passion for innovative product design and a strong foundation in CAD modeling. With experience using Catia V5, SolidWorks, NX, and Alias, I specialize in plastic product design, component development, and automation using design tools.


My focus is on building practical, real-world solutions by combining creativity with technical precision. I enjoy taking on complex challenges that require both design aesthetics and engineering functionality — especially in the automotive space.


Beyond software tools, I value teamwork, detail orientation, and continuous learning. I thrive in dynamic environments where design meets innovation, and I’m always looking forward to collaborating on projects that make a difference.
